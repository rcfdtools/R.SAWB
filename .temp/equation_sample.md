Generally, the water content in the atmosphere in the solid and liquid phases is negligible, and the simplified equation will be described as:

<div align="center">

$\frac{\delta W}{\delta t}=-\nabla_{H}\cdot\vec{Q}+(E-P)$

</div>

Where:  

$\frac{\delta W}{\delta t}$ = variation of precipitable water in the time  
$\nabla_{H}$ = horizontal divergence  
$\vec{Q} = (Q_{\alpha},Q_{\phi})$ = vapor flux vector, and the components are directed towards east and north  
$E$ = evapotranspiration  
$P$ =  precipitation<br>
