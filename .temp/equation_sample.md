Generally, the water content in the atmosphere in the solid and liquid phases is negligible, and the simplified equation will be described as:\n\n<div align="center">\n\n$\frac{\delta W}{\delta t}=-\nabla_{H}\cdot\vec{Q}+(E-P)$
\n</div>\n\nWhere:\n\n$\frac{\delta W}{\delta t}$ = variation of precipitable water in the time\n$\nabla_{H}$ = horizontal divergence\n$\vec{Q} = (Q_{\alpha},Q_{\phi})$ = vapor flux vector, and the components are directed towards east and north\n$E$ = evapotranspiration\n\n$P$ =  precipitation
