## System configuration for big NetCDF files over Windows 11

1. Press the <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> keys on your keyboard to open the Run dialog.
2. Type `sysdm.cpl` in the text box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The System Properties menu will open.
3. Navigate to the `Advanced` tab. You are now in the Advanced System Settings menu.
4. Under `Performance`, clic on `Settings`.
5. Under `Performance Options`, navigate to the `Advanced` tab.
6. Under the `Virtual memory` section, clic on `Change`.
7. Uncheck the box `Automatically manage paging file size for all drives`.
8. Select the Drive C: and set a virtual memory custom size with Initial size in 5120Mb and Maximum size in 10240Mb. 
9. Clic on `OK`, `Apply`, `Ok`.
10. Restart your Windows system.

> You can also set a custom size virtual memory for the drives where your data processing is running.
> 
> The specific virtual memory size depends on the size of your NetCDF files.
